# little-professor

Implementation of the little professor from the 70's


## Run it via command-line 

Enter a level between 1 and 3 (inclusive) 
    Level 1 = single diit numbers
    Level 2 = double digit numbers
    Level 3 = triple digit numbers

Enter an operand (+,-,*,/).

I want to add a GUI to it, but I need to figure out how. 
Have fun with it and feel free to report bugs!
